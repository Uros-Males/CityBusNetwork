# CityBusNetwork
C++ program in object oriented paradigm which implements the bus network of some city. 
User can input the bus stops, bus lines and their time schedule via file. 
One of the possible queries of the program is, when given 2 bus stations and time when the passenger arives, program outputs the path between them that is optimal time-wise
and also outputs the path that changes as few bus lines as possible to get to the aimed bus stop.
